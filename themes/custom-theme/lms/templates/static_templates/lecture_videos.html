The videos cover all the Learning Objectives for each topic in the ABC curriculum, as prescribed by GARP. The videos are organized in our Learning Mangement System in the same order as they are in our study planner for ABC. The concepts are covered completely from scratch, and, even if you have no background in Statistics or Finance, you don’t need to worry about it.</span></p><p class="aLF-aPX-K0-aPE"><span style="color: #000000;">According to Micky – “We have not established TestSite only for helping the candidates to pass the ABC and CFA exams. Shortcuts, tips, and tricks are definitely helpful, but they should not be too much relied upon. The main focus should be on understanding the underlying dynamics behind the concepts and their implementation. Over the years, the popularity of the CFA and ABC certifications has grown enormously, and there has been a surge in the number of candidates who clear all the levels of these exams. But even after passing the exams, very few candidates manage to impress with their core finance skills. I’ve heard a number of recruiters saying that extremely qualified candidates are not able to answer basic interview questions. From a Financial Risk Practioner’s perspective, an ABC certification can add value only if the candidate has followed a holistic approach to prepare for the exam and crack it. For Example – If 1 day 99% VaR changed by 10%, then the candidate should not only be able to identify the cause and risk type associated with such a change, but also be able to analyze the underlying VaR model and explain this phenomenon, either by mathematically deriving it, or through the use of visual aids wherever possible.”</span></p><p class="aLF-aPX-K0-aPE"><span style="color: #000000;">Micky Midha will help you visualize the difficult quantitative ideas in the ABC curriculum through his videos, by the extensive use of graphs, figures, and tables. Numerous examples that are aligned to the GARP ABC Learning Objectives have been discussed in the videos. This way, your learning experience will be enhanced as you make your way towards passing the ABC exams.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div>
